I have a CSV file named 'AirPassengers' from kaggle as my dataset, which includes columns for the month and the number of passengers that traveled each month from 1949 to 1960. In my machine learning Jupyter notebook, I used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize the data and trained the dataset on the ARIMA model to predict trends. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical model that uses past values to predict future values. It has three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA). The AR component captures the linear relationship between the current and past observations. Differencing makes the time series stationary. The MA component models the error term as a linear combination of past errors.
